### üí≠ Learnings:
Crafted entirely for iOS using Swift, this project was a delightful journey that not only allowed me to reinforce my existing knowledge but also enabled me to delve deeper into the intricacies of app development. One of the most rewarding aspects was honing my UI skills through the meticulous creation of interfaces using UIKit. By eschewing Interface Builder and opting for programmatic UI development, I found myself immersed in a process that afforded me unprecedented control over the visual presentation and functionality of the app.

However, the learning didn't stop there. Embracing Core Data introduced me to the realm of data persistence within iOS applications. This powerful framework enabled me to seamlessly manage and store user data, including their preferences and saved information, without relying on external databases. It was a significant milestone in my journey as an iOS developer, as it not only broadened my understanding of app architecture but also enhanced the overall user experience by providing a smoother and more personalized interaction.

Moreover, the integration of external APIs, such as the well-documented Spotify API, opened up a world of possibilities. Leveraging these APIs allowed me to enrich the app's functionality by tapping into vast repositories of data and services. It was a valuable learning experience that underscored the importance of staying abreast of the latest technologies and APIs in the ever-evolving landscape of mobile development.

In essence, this project was more than just a coding exercise; it was a journey of growth and discovery. It equipped me with invaluable skills and insights that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors in iOS development.
